About Me
======
Hi, I'm Kun Wang (Ken), a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn), advised by [Dr. Li Lu](https://lynnlilu.github.io).
I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Security from the same college at Zhejiang University in 2021.
My research focuses on **Machine Learning Security**, particularly in developing defenses against adversarial examples, backdoor attacks, and deepfakes, with a special emphasis on the audio domain.
